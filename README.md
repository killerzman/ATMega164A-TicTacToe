# ATMega164A Tic-Tac-Toe

ATMega164A that was programmed to interact with a grid of LEDs and a few buttons to simulate a game of Tic-Tac-Toe ("X È™i 0" in romanian)

This project was made in year 3 of my university studies at Politehnica University of Bucharest @ Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications and Information Technology

The code implementation was a bit **rushed** and the documentation (the .docx file) is in **Romanian** so **browse at your own risk!**
